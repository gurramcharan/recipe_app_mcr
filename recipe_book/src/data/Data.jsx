        img: "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/5196280m1IL.jpg",
        ingredients: `1 cup of chocolate (you can use milk chocolate, dark chocolate, or semi-sweet chocolate), 1 tablespoon of coconut oil or vegetable oil (optional, but it helps with the texture), A pinch of salt (optional, for enhancing the flavor)`,
        instructions: `Step 1: Start by preparing a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.Step 2: Break the chocolate into small pieces and place them in a microwave-safe bowl. If you prefer, you can also use chocolate chips or chocolate bars chopped into small chunks.Step 3: If you're using coconut oil or vegetable oil, add it to the bowl with the chocolate. The oil helps to melt the chocolate smoothly and gives it nice texture. Step 4: Microwave the bowl in short intervals of 20-30 seconds, stirring after each interval. Continue microwaving and stirring until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth. Be careful not to overheat the chocolate, as it can burn easily. Step 5: If desired, add a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor of the chocolate. Step 6: Once the chocolate is melted and smooth, you can transfer it to a piping bag or a resealable plastic bag. If using a plastic bag, cut a small hole in one corner for piping. Step 7: Pipe small drops or shapes onto the prepared baking sheet, forming the chocolate chips. You can make them as big or as small as you prefer. Step 8: Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for about 15-20 minutes or until the chocolate chips are firm and set. Step 9: Once the chocolate chips are set, you can remove them from the baking sheet and store them in an airtight container at room temperature. They will stay fresh for several weeks.`
